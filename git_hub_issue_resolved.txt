I believe I have found a solution to this problem. None of the solutions above worked for me. I think the root cause of this issue is that GitHub has ended support for password authentication on August 13, 2021.
 Instead a personal access token needs to be used.

The steps to solve this issue are as follows:

1.Create a personal access token on GitHub.com. Tutorial here
Go back to Visual Studio Code and open terminal. Type in the following command with your own
 user information:
2. go to developer setting for Personal Access Token
git remote set-url origin https://<TOKEN>@github.com/<user_name>/<repo_name>.git
